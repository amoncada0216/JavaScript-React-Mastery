# Frontend Mastery — Phase Cutoffs for Top 10% Level

This document defines:
- the study order (already agreed)
- the **exact phase cutoff** for each map
- what that cutoff enables you to **prove via projects**

---

## 1. JavaScript Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **Advanced JS (but not academic extremes)**

You must complete:
- All foundations
- Core semantics
- Functions & closures
- Data transformation
- Async JavaScript
- Enough memory model to avoid leaks

You may stop BEFORE:
- Deep engine implementation details
- Full prototype chain theory beyond usage
- Spec-level edge cases

### Why this cutoff matters
This level lets you:
- write clean, predictable logic
- reason about async bugs
- design state and data flow confidently
- explain *why* something broke

### Project signal
- Complex stateful UI without Redux
- Async-heavy app (polling, retries, cancellation)
- Zero accidental mutation bugs

---

## 2. HTML & Semantics Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **Full semantic + form mastery**

You must complete:
- Document structure
- Semantic sectioning
- Headings and outline
- Forms and inputs
- Native behaviors
- Accessibility baseline

You may stop BEFORE:
- Obscure HTML elements
- SEO micro-optimizations

### Why this cutoff matters
At this level:
- your markup is clean, readable, accessible
- you rely less on JS to fix UX problems
- your UI degrades gracefully

### Project signal
- Form-heavy app with minimal JS hacks
- Correct keyboard navigation by default
- Clean DOM tree (no div soup)

---

## 3. CSS Architecture Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **Layout + maintainability mastery**

You must complete:
- Cascade and specificity
- Box model deeply
- Flexbox fully
- Grid practically
- Responsive layouts
- Architecture patterns (at least one)

You may stop BEFORE:
- Advanced motion design systems
- Full enterprise design systems

### Why this cutoff matters
This is the line between:
- “styles work”
- and “styles scale”

### Project signal
- Responsive layout with zero hacks
- Easy-to-change styles
- No specificity fights
- Confident deletion of CSS

---

## 4. Browser Internals Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **Rendering + event loop clarity**

You must complete:
- Parsing pipeline
- Render tree → layout → paint
- What blocks rendering
- Event loop (tasks vs microtasks)
- Main thread constraints

You may stop BEFORE:
- JS engine internals
- GC algorithm details
- Fiber-level scheduling

### Why this cutoff matters
This is where devs stop guessing.

### Project signal
- You can explain why a render is slow
- You avoid layout thrashing instinctively
- You debug timing issues without panic

---

## 5. React Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **Full mental model mastery**

You must complete:
- Rendering model
- Props/state as snapshots
- Derived vs source state
- Lists & keys
- Effects (correct dependency reasoning)
- Controlled inputs
- Re-render causes

You may stop BEFORE:
- Concurrent internals
- Experimental APIs

### Why this cutoff matters
This is the difference between:
- “React works”
- and “React obeys me”

### Project signal
- No infinite re-render bugs
- Minimal effects
- Predictable state flow
- Components that refactor cleanly

---

## 6. TypeScript Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **Strong application typing**

You must complete:
- Inference
- Object & function typing
- Union types
- Narrowing
- Typing React components
- Enforcing invariants

You may stop BEFORE:
- Heavy conditional types
- Type-level gymnastics

### Why this cutoff matters
You get safety *without* slowing down.

### Project signal
- Very few runtime bugs
- Refactors feel safe
- Types guide usage, not fight you

---

## 7. Build Tools Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **Operational confidence**

You must complete:
- Dev vs prod differences
- Bundling concepts
- Code splitting conceptually
- Source maps
- Env variables

You may stop BEFORE:
- Writing custom plugins
- Tool internals

### Why this cutoff matters
You are no longer blocked by tooling.

### Project signal
- You can debug prod-only bugs
- You understand build output
- You can optimize bundle size deliberately

---

## 8. Git & Version Control Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **Calm recovery mastery**

You must complete:
- History model
- Branching
- Merge vs rebase
- Conflict resolution
- Undo/recovery
- PR workflows

You may stop BEFORE:
- Rare workflows
- Extreme bisect usage

### Why this cutoff matters
Teams trust you.

### Project signal
- Clean commit history
- Fearless refactors
- No panic when things go wrong

---

## 9. Testing Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **Behavior-focused testing**

You must complete:
- What to test
- Unit vs integration
- Async testing
- Avoiding brittle tests

You may stop BEFORE:
- Massive E2E suites

### Project signal
- Tests that survive refactors
- Bugs caught early
- No test hell

---

## 10. Web Performance Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **User-perceived performance mastery**

You must complete:
- Loading strategy
- Render cost
- JS execution cost
- Core Web Vitals

You may stop BEFORE:
- Exotic micro-optimizations

### Project signal
- Fast-feeling apps
- Measurable improvements
- Correct tradeoffs

---

## 11. Accessibility Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **Practical a11y correctness**

You must complete:
- Semantics
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- Forms accessibility

You may stop BEFORE:
- AAA edge cases

### Project signal
- Keyboard-usable apps
- Screen-reader sane
- No retrofitting required

---

## 12. Security Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **Defensive awareness**

You must complete:
- XSS
- CSRF
- Auth basics
- Client trust boundaries

You may stop BEFORE:
- Security research depth

### Project signal
- No obvious vulnerabilities
- Safe client-side decisions

---

## 13. Networking Mastery Map

### Study UNTIL: **API + failure reasoning**

You must complete:
- HTTP lifecycle
- Caching
- Latency sources
- Failure modes

You may stop BEFORE:
- Protocol deep dives

### Project signal
- Robust data fetching
- Graceful failures
- Correct caching assumptions

---

## 14. Redux Mastery Map (Optional)

### Study ONLY IF:
- App state becomes truly global and complex

Otherwise:
- Skip entirely

---

## FINAL RESULT

If you reach **these phase cutoffs** and express them in **2–3 strong projects**:

You are:
- an *outstanding* frontend engineer
- fast, safe, predictable
- easy to trust
- expensive to replace

This is the level where:
**recruiters stop testing fundamentals and start discussing impact.**
