# JavaScript + React Mastery — Long-Term Learning Repository

This repository documents my deliberate path toward **deep, professional-level mastery of JavaScript**, with React as the practical end goal.

This is **not** a tutorial repo.  
It is **not** a collection of snippets.  
It is a record of *thinking*, mistakes, corrections, and mental models.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to make JavaScript **predictable**.

Not “familiar”.  
Not “usable”.  
Predictable.

I am building an internal model of how JavaScript actually works so that:
- Bugs can be reasoned about, not guessed
- React behavior feels inevitable, not magical
- Code changes are intentional, not hopeful

This repo exists so that in 10–20 years I can come back and clearly see:
> *How I learned to think, not just what I learned.*

## How this repository is used

### 1. `JavaScript + React Mastery Map.md`

This file defines the **learning scope and order**.

- Topics are studied **one by one**
- Nothing is skipped
- Nothing is marked as complete until it is mentally stable
- Sections 0–1 (JavaScript Core) are treated as **non-negotiable foundations**

The map exists to prevent:
- Rushing
- Shallow understanding
- Accidental gaps

---

### 2. `Notes.md`

This is my **raw thinking log**.

It contains:
- Mental models
- Diagrams described in words (“boxes”, references, execution flow)
- Edge cases that broke my intuition
- Corrections after being wrong
- Rules rewritten until they make sense

Notes are:
- Personal
- Unpolished
- Honest

Clarity > presentation.

### 3. `Sandbox.jsx`

This is a **scratchpad**, not production code.

Used for:
- Running exercises
- Verifying predictions
- Breaking code on purpose
- Isolating behaviors

Nothing here is meant to be “clean”.  
It exists purely to **observe behavior**.

---

### 4. `Study Prompt.md`

This file defines the **rules of engagement** for how I study.

It sets:
- Teaching constraints
- Pacing rules
- Scope boundaries
- Style expectations

I use an AI tutor under these strict rules to:
- Force prediction before explanation
- Slow down when confused
- Eliminate hand-wavy understanding

This keeps the learning process **controlled and intentional**.

---

## Learning method

The method is deliberately strict:

- One concept at a time
- Prediction before execution
- Reasoning before answers
- Confusion treated as a signal to slow down
- No new tools unless explicitly allowed

Progress is measured by:
- Ability to predict outcomes
- Ability to explain *why*
- Reduction of “surprise” behavior

---

## Why this matters

Most JavaScript problems are not syntax problems.
They are **mental model problems**.

This repository is an attempt to fix that permanently.

If future me is reading this:

You didn’t rush.  
You didn’t skip foundations.  
You chose understanding over speed.

That choice compounds.
