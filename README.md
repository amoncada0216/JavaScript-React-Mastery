# JavaScript Mastery — A Long-Term Learning Log

This repository documents my journey to **deep, professional-level understanding of JavaScript**, with a strong focus on the parts that actually matter for real-world development (and React).

It is **not** a collection of tutorials or snippets.  
It is a **thinking log**.

I commit here every time a concept truly *clicks*.

## Why this repository exists

Most people “learn” JavaScript by memorizing syntax.  
I decided to do the opposite.

This repo exists to:

- Build **predictable mental models**, not habits
- Eliminate “magic” from JavaScript behavior
- Train **reasoning**, not recall
- Track progress honestly, step by step

If I ever come back to this in 5, 10, or 20 years, the goal is simple:

> Read this and remember *exactly* how and why things work.

## Structure

### 1. Learning Map

The learning map defines **what is studied and in what order**.  
Nothing is skipped. Nothing is rushed.

It is organized roughly as:

- Core programming foundations
- JavaScript internals critical for React
- Functions as behavior units
- Data transformation
- React-specific layers (later)

Each section is only marked “done” when it is **predictable**, not just familiar.

---

### 2. Notes

The notes file is where the real work lives.

It contains:
- Mental models (boxes, references, execution flow)
- Edge cases that broke my intuition
- Corrections after being wrong
- Rules distilled into single sentences
- “Oh shit, now I get it” moments

Nothing is polished.  
Clarity > prettiness.

---

### 3. Commits

Each commit represents **real progress**, not activity.

Commits happen when:
- A concept stops being fragile
- I can predict behavior without guessing
- I can explain *why*, not just *what*

This repo is intentionally slow-growing.

---

## How this was studied

- One concept at a time
- No new tools unless explicitly allowed
- Heavy use of prediction exercises
- Frequent deliberate confusion and correction
- No moving on until understanding is solid

If something felt confusing, that was a signal to **slow down**, not speed up.

---

## Current focus

At the moment, the focus has been on:

- Execution context and scope
- Value vs reference
- Immutability vs mutation
- `this` binding
- Destructuring defaults
- `==` vs `===`
- `||` vs `??`
- Truthy / falsy edge cases
- Predictable control flow

These are the foundations everything else depends on.

---

## Long-term goal

To reach a point where:

- JavaScript behavior feels **inevitable**, not surprising
- React feels like a thin layer on top of known rules
- Debugging is reasoning, not trial and error
- Code changes are intentional, not hopeful

---

## Final note to future me

If you’re reading this years from now:

You were patient when it mattered.  
You didn’t skip the hard parts.  
You chose understanding over speed.

That choice compounds.

Keep going.
