# FAST FRONTEND DEVELOPER MAP
## JavaScript-Heavy • Efficient • Hireable-First 

This map is optimized to:
- get you **hireable as fast as possible**
- put **most depth where it compounds (JavaScript)**
- avoid over-studying theory that doesn’t unblock shipping UI

---

## STAGE 0 — JAVASCRIPT CORE (≈50% OF YOUR TIME)

> Weak JS = impossible React.  
> This is where you go deep.

### JavaScript — Foundations
- [x] Expressions vs statements  
- [x] Control flow (`if`, `switch`)  
- [x] Loops (`for`)  
- [ ] `while` / `do…while`  
- [ ] `for…of`  
- [ ] `for…in`  
- [x] Truthy / falsy  
- [x] Error handling (`try/catch`)  
- [x] Reading stack traces  

---

### JavaScript — Execution & Scope (CRITICAL)
- [x] Execution context  
- [x] Call stack  
- [x] Lexical scope  
- [x] Scope chain  
- [x] Closures (creation + lifetime)  
- [x] Hoisting (functions vs variables)  
- [x] `this` binding rules  

---

### JavaScript — Values, Identity & Mutation (BUG FACTORY)
- [x] Primitives vs objects  
- [x] Value vs reference  
- [x] Immutability vs mutation  
- [x] Type coercion rules  
- [x] `==` vs `===`  
- [ ] Object / array equality traps  
- [ ] Shallow vs deep copy  
- [ ] Accidental mutation patterns  

---

### JavaScript — Functions (REACT BRIDGE)
- [x] Function declarations vs expressions  
- [x] Arrow functions (syntax + semantics)  
- [x] Higher-order functions  
- [x] Pure vs impure functions  
- [x] Default parameters  
- [x] Closures in practice  
- [ ] Currying (basic)  
- [ ] Function composition (basic)  

---

### JavaScript — Data Transformation (DAILY WORK)
- [x] `map`  
- [x] `filter`  
- [x] `reduce`  
- [x] Defensive counting logic  
- [x] Edge-case handling  
- [x] String normalization  
- [ ] Chaining transforms cleanly  
- [ ] Avoiding mutation in transforms  

---

### JavaScript — Arrays & Objects (FLUENCY)
**Arrays**
- [x] `.includes()`  
- [x] `.some()`  
- [ ] `.every()`  
- [ ] `.find()`  
- [ ] `.findIndex()`  
- [ ] `.slice()`  
- [ ] `.concat()`  
- [ ] `.sort()` (mutation trap)  
- [ ] `Array.isArray()`  

**Objects**
- [ ] `Object.keys()`  
- [ ] `Object.values()`  
- [ ] `Object.entries()`  
- [ ] Shallow copy patterns (`{...obj}`, `[...arr]`)  
- [ ] Safe nested access patterns  

---

### JavaScript — Async (NON-OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Promise lifecycle  
- [ ] `.then()` vs `async / await`  
- [ ] Error handling in async flows  
- [ ] Sequential vs parallel async  
- [ ] Race conditions  
- [ ] Event loop mental model (practical)  

---

## STAGE 1 — HTML & CSS (ENOUGH TO NOT FAIL)

> Learn **correctness**, not artistry.

### HTML & Semantics
- [ ] Document structure  
- [ ] Semantic sectioning elements  
- [ ] Headings hierarchy  
- [ ] Links vs buttons  
- [ ] Forms & labels  
- [ ] Input types  
- [ ] Native browser behaviors  
- [ ] HTML accessibility baseline  

---

### CSS Fundamentals (SURVIVAL MODE)
- [ ] Cascade & specificity  
- [ ] Box model  
- [ ] `box-sizing`  
- [ ] Flexbox (master this)  
- [ ] Grid (basic usage)  
- [ ] Responsive units  
- [ ] Avoiding specificity wars  

---

## STAGE 2 — BROWSER BASICS (JUST ENOUGH)

> Not internals yet — just **why things break**.

- [ ] What the browser does  
- [ ] HTML → DOM  
- [ ] CSS → CSSOM  
- [ ] Render tree  
- [ ] Layout vs paint  
- [ ] What blocks rendering  
- [ ] Main thread concept  

---

## STAGE 3 — REACT (START EARLY)

### React — Core
- [x] JSX rules  
- [x] Function components  
- [x] Props as arguments  
- [x] Props immutability  
- [x] `useState`  
- [x] Event handlers  
- [x] Controlled inputs  

---

### React — Rendering Mental Model
- [ ] Props/state are snapshots  
- [ ] Re-render ≠ DOM update  
- [ ] Derived data ≠ state  
- [ ] Re-render causes  
- [ ] Keys as identity  
- [ ] Conditional rendering  

---

### React — Effects (DO NOT RUSH)
- [ ] Side effects vs render logic  
- [ ] `useEffect` timing  
- [ ] Dependency arrays  
- [ ] Cleanup functions  
- [ ] Avoiding infinite loops  
- [ ] Stale closures in React  

---

## STAGE 4 — TYPESCRIPT (EMPLOYABILITY BOOST)
- [ ] Type inference  
- [ ] Basic typing  
- [ ] Object typing  
- [ ] Function typing  
- [ ] Union types  
- [ ] Narrowing  
- [ ] Typing React props  
- [ ] Avoiding `any`  

---

## STAGE 5 — BUILD TOOLS (MINIMUM VIABLE)
- [ ] What a build tool does  
- [ ] Dev vs prod  
- [ ] Bundling concept  
- [ ] Code splitting (conceptual)  
- [ ] Source maps  
- [ ] Environment variables  

---

## STAGE 6 — AFTER YOU’RE HIRED (DO NOT BLOCK ON THESE)
- [ ] Testing  
- [ ] Performance  
- [ ] Accessibility (deep)  
- [ ] Security  
- [ ] Redux  

---

## FINAL TRUTH

- If you fully master **Stage 0 + Stage 3**, you can already build real apps.
- Over-studying theory early **slows hiring**, not speeds it.
- This map maximizes **speed without future regret**.
