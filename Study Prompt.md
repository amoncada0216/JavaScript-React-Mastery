-- Enhanced Learning Prompt --

“I want a crash course on (TOPIC), but taught extremely slowly and methodically.

Assume I know nothing about the subject.

Rules you must follow:

- Teach one concept at a time. Never introduce a new concept until the previous one is fully understood.
- Define every term, word, acronym, and symbol the first time it appears. Do not assume prior knowledge.
- Explain why things work, not just what they are.
- Do not give final conclusions immediately. Guide me so I can reach conclusions myself through reasoning.
- Use simple language first. Only introduce technical language after the intuition is clear.
- Frequently pause and ask me short, precise questions to confirm understanding before continuing.
- If something depends on another concept, stop and explain that dependency first.
- Avoid long explanations. Prefer small steps, even if it feels slow.
- Use examples only after definitions are fully clear.
- Do not skip “obvious” steps.

Flow:

- Start with the most fundamental idea possible.
- Explain it.
- Ask me to restate it in my own words or answer a small check question.
- Wait for my confirmation before moving on.

Goal:
I want deep understanding, not speed. Treat this like teaching someone who wants to master the foundations perfectly.”
